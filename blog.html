                    GitHub Pages is an amazing platform for hosting static websites directly from your GitHub repository. 
                    In this post, I'll share my experience setting up this personal website and some tips I learned along the way.

                <p>
                    One of the best things about GitHub Pages is that it's completely free and integrates seamlessly with your 
                    development workflow. You can use custom domains, HTTPS, and even Jekyll for more advanced site generation.

                    In today's digital age, having an online presence is crucial for career development. Your personal website 
                    serves as your digital business card, portfolio, and a way to share your thoughts with the world.

                <p>
                    I decided to create this website to consolidate my online presence and have a central hub where people can 
                    learn about my work, read my blog posts, and access my professional resume. It's been a rewarding journey!

                <h2>The Importance of Clean Code</h2>
                <div class="post-meta">Posted on January 5, 2025 | 6 min read</div>
                <p>
                    Writing clean, maintainable code is one of the most important skills a developer can have. It's not just 
                    about making code work—it's about making it readable, understandable, and easy to modify in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I've learned that time spent writing clean code upfront saves countless hours later. 
                    Good variable names, clear function purposes, and well-structured code make all the difference in long-term 
                    project success.

                <h2>Learning Web Development in 2025</h2>
                <div class="post-meta">Posted on January 1, 2025 | 7 min read</div>
                <p>
                    Web development continues to evolve at a rapid pace. With new frameworks, tools, and best practices emerging 
                    regularly, it's important to stay current while also mastering the fundamentals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I always recommend starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics before diving into frameworks. A solid 
                    foundation in these core technologies will serve you well regardless of which modern framework you eventually 
                    choose to learn.
